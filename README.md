# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Continue this code using React and Babel for Fast Refresh:
First, install the plugin:

bash

Copy code

npm install --save-dev @vitejs/plugin-react

Next, import and use the plugin in your vite.config.js file:

javascript

Copy code

import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
